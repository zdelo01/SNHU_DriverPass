# SNHU_DriverPass 

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

The DriverPass is a business that seeks to enter the market to aid students in passing their behind-the-wheel test. The client, Liam requested that this system provides the following services to its customers: on-the-road driving lessons, in-person lessons explaining DMV rules and policies, online classes, and practice tests 

    
# What did you do particularly well? 

I created UML diagrams for this project that are organized, functional, and easy to understand for the client. I also broke down the required system components clearly with minimal technical jargon for the nontechnical audience.  

     
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I would revise the performance requirements by being more specific such as explicitly stating a time requirement for the system response. I would also add that the system should be updated not just when new features are rolled out but any other system maintenance whether it's to fix a coding error, adapt to changes in the business environment, or code against potential future errors.  

  
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I interpreted the user’s needs by studying the interview transcript to determine the functional requirements to bring value to the user and fulfill the system’s purpose. It’s important to consider the user’s needs in designing a system because ultimately the user will be engaging with the system within their daily life and will be expecting a user-friendly experience that gives them functional value. Essentially, if we build a system that does not meet the user’s needs, the system will not serve its purpose. 

 
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

I approach designing software as a complex problem to solve and look for a practical solution that will meet the needs of the client and the system. I would create UML diagrams in the future to either break down the objects and relationships in a system or a specific function that the system provides. I would also write software specs in the future and document all the functional/nonfunctional requirements and purpose of the system.
